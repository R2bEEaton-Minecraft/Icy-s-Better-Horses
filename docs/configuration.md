## The config file

Better Horses writes a JSON file to your config directory on first launch:

```
config/icys-better-horses.json
```

It's created automatically with every option enabled, so you only need to touch it if you want to turn something off.

The default file, abbreviated. The `abilities` block holds one entry for every class perk and every breed ability, all `"yes"` except the two noted below:

```json
{
  "stabilizer": "yes",
  "medkit": "yes",
  "hooves": "yes",
  "horse_exclusivity": "yes",
  "multiriding": "yes",
  "horse_combat": "yes",
  "transparent_horses": "yes",
  "gender_breeding": "yes",
  "horse_pvp": "yes",
  "cart_pickup": "yes",
  "tuning": {
    "bond_per_interval": 1,
    "bond_interval_minutes": 1,
    "spawn_weight": 5,
    "spawn_group_min": 2,
    "spawn_group_max": 6,
    "spawn_probability_floor": 0.1
  },
  "spawner": {
    "enabled": "yes",
    "check_interval_ticks": 100,
    "chance": 0.5,
    "min_distance": 32,
    "max_distance": 48,
    "max_horses_per_chunk": 1
  },
  "abilities": {
    "class_abilities": "yes",
    "breed_abilities": "yes",
    "class": {
      "war_steady": "yes",
      "pony_fall": "yes"
    },
    "breed": {
      "shire_brick": "no",
      "belgian_brick": "no",
      "thoroughbred_top_end": "yes"
    }
  }
}
```

## Feature toggles

| Key | Default | What turning it off does |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| `stabilizer` | `yes` | [Horse Stabilizers](equipment/horse-stabilizer) stop deploying, so no gliding descent and no fall protection |
| `medkit` | `yes` | [Horse Medkits](equipment/horse-medkit) never activate |
| `hooves` | `yes` | [Horse Hooves](equipment/horse-hooves) lose snow walking, fall reduction, and Frost Walker |
| `horse_exclusivity` | `yes` | **Any player can ride any owned horse**, useful for shared stables |
| `multiriding` | `yes` | Only one player per horse; no second rider |
| `horse_combat` | `yes` | No charging, kicking, owner defence or spooking. See [Combat](combat) |
| `transparent_horses` | `yes` | The horse stops fading out when you look down while riding it |
| `gender_breeding` | `yes` | Gender stops gating breeding, so any two horses can pair. See [Genetics](genetics) |
| `horse_pvp` | `yes` | A charge or kick can no longer hurt **any player**, or **any animal a player owns**. Horses still fight mobs |
| `cart_pickup` | `yes` | Animals stop climbing into a [cart](equipment/horse-cart) bed on their own. Players can still ride it |

{: .tip }
> `horse_pvp` is the one to turn off on a PvE or family server. With it off a charging horse ploughs through zombies exactly as before, but rides straight past other players, their wolves, their cats, and their own horses.

---

## Tuning

Six numbers under a `tuning` block. These are the values most servers actually want to move.

| Key | Default | What it does |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| `bond_per_interval` | `1` | Bond gained each interval while the owner is within 10 blocks. **`0` turns passive bonding off entirely**, leaving name tags and golden apples as the only sources |
| `bond_interval_minutes` | `1` | Minutes between each passive gain |
| `spawn_weight` | `5` | How often horses win against other animals in a biome. **`0` stops the mod adding horse spawns at all** |
| `spawn_group_min` | `2` | Fewest horses in a naturally spawned herd |
| `spawn_group_max` | `6` | Most horses in a herd |
| `spawn_probability_floor` | `0.1` | Biomes with no horses and a lower animal spawn chance get raised to this, so horses actually appear |

The two bond numbers are a pair. The default pair is "+1 per minute", which is 100 minutes from a fresh tame to full bond. To halve that, either double the gain or halve the interval:

```json
{ "tuning": { "bond_per_interval": 2, "bond_interval_minutes": 1 } }
```

{: .note }
> Spawn settings are read when a world loads its biomes, so changing them needs a restart, not a `/reload`.

## Spawner

Horses also come from a small built-in spawner. It runs on the server, and it does not use the vanilla animal mob cap or spawn weights. That means other mods' animals in a big pack can't crowd horses out. It works like Cobblemon's spawner. On a timer, it picks one spot near each player, between a minimum and maximum distance away, in a horse biome. If that chunk has fewer than the allowed number of wild horses, it spawns one. This keeps horses coming back without piling up, and never right on top of the player.

| Key | Default | What it does |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| `enabled` | `yes` | `no` turns the spawner off, leaving only the normal biome spawns |
| `check_interval_ticks` | `100` | Ticks between spawn checks near each player (20 ticks is one second) |
| `chance` | `0.5` | Chance that a check goes ahead (0 to 1) |
| `min_distance` | `32` | Closest a horse can appear to a player, in blocks (16 blocks is one chunk) |
| `max_distance` | `48` | Farthest a horse can appear from a player, in blocks |
| `max_horses_per_chunk` | `1` | Most wild horses allowed in one chunk. Tamed, owned and named horses don't count |

If `max_horses_per_chunk` is above `1`, a spawn can be a small herd. Herd size uses `spawn_group_min` and `spawn_group_max` from the tuning table above, cut down to fit the chunk. To get more horses, lower `check_interval_ticks` or raise `chance` or `max_horses_per_chunk`. To get fewer, do the opposite. These are read at startup, so restart the server after editing.

---

## Ability toggles

Every [class perk and breed ability](breeds/) has its own switch under the `abilities` block, so you can keep the breeds and disable only the parts you don't want.

| Key | Default | Scope |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| `abilities.class_abilities` | `yes` | Master switch for all five **class** perks. Off means no war-horse steadiness, no draft hauling, no pony step height, and so on |
| `abilities.breed_abilities` | `yes` | Master switch for every **breed** ability. Off means the fifteen breeds keep their stats, coats, and biomes but lose their signature powers |
| `abilities.class.<name>` | `yes` | One class perk, e.g. `war_steady`, `pony_fall`, `draft_haul`, `western_road` |
| `abilities.breed.<name>` | `yes` | One breed ability, e.g. `thoroughbred_top_end`, `percheron_chain`, `appaloosa_herd` |

Two are **off by default**, because they let a horse break the world:

| Key | Default | What turning it on does |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| `abilities.breed.shire_brick` | `no` | A bond-100 Shire at a gallop smashes blocks on the `horse_breakable` tag |
| `abilities.breed.belgian_brick` | `no` | The same for a bond-100 Belgian |

The full list of key names is written into the file on first launch, so the easiest way to find one is to open the generated config and read it.

### Accepted values

Each key is forgiving about format. All of these mean the same thing:

| True | False |
|:---|:---|
| `"yes"`, `"true"`, `"on"`, `"1"`, `"enabled"` | `"no"`, `"false"`, `"off"`, `"0"`, `"disabled"` |
| `true` *(boolean)* | `false` *(boolean)* |
| any non-zero number | `0` |

Unrecognised values fall back to the default and log a warning.

{: .note }
> Missing keys are filled in and the file is rewritten automatically, so a config from an older version picks up new options without you editing it by hand.

{: .warning }
> If the file is **malformed**, the mod runs on defaults for that session and **leaves your file untouched**, so nothing you set is lost to a stray comma. It logs a warning telling you so. Fix the JSON and restart to get your settings back; the file is never overwritten out from under you.

---

## On a server

The config is **server-authoritative**. When you join a dedicated server the host's values take over for the session, and the in-game settings screen locks with a note saying so. Your own file is remembered and comes back the moment you disconnect.

That means a server owner only has to edit the config once, on the server, and every player gets the same rules without downloading anything.

---

## Dummy mode

Disabling a gear item doesn't remove it from the game. Instead it drops into **dummy mode**: still craftable, still equippable, rendered normally, but inert.

That means a server that disables stabilizers doesn't break existing worlds or delete anyone's items, and players can still use the models decoratively in a display stable. Nothing fires in the world.

---

## In-game editing

With [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) installed, the same options are editable through a settings screen at **Mods → Icy's Better Horses → Configure**, without touching the file. Changes are written straight back to `icys-better-horses.json`.

Both mods are **optional**. Without them, edit the JSON directly.

The screen has four tabs: **General** for the nine feature toggles, **Class abilities** and **Breed abilities** for the per-ability switches grouped by class and by breed, and **Keybinds** for all seven keys:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Horse Whistle / Info | <kbd>P</kbd> | Whistles your horse, calls it off a fight, or opens the info screen while riding |
| Horse Command Wheel | <kbd>R</kbd> | Opens the command wheel on a horse you own or are trusted with |
| Manage Horses | <kbd>G</kbd> | Opens the roster of every horse you own |
| Walk Cycle | <kbd>V</kbd> | Shifts up through the [gaits](riding#gaits) while riding |
| Rear | <kbd>H</kbd> | Makes the horse you're riding, or looking at, rear up |
| Free Look | <kbd>Left Ctrl</kbd> | Held: look around freely without the horse turning at all |
| Cart Size | <kbd>Left Alt</kbd> | Swaps a [cart](equipment/horse-cart) between the small cart and the large wagon |

Keybinds are also rebindable the normal way in **Options → Controls → Icy's Better Horses**.

{: .warning }
> Three defaults collide with vanilla keys: <kbd>P</kbd> is Social Interactions, <kbd>Left Ctrl</kbd> is Sprint, and <kbd>Left Alt</kbd> is commonly bound by other mods. Minecraft marks clashes in red on the controls screen. Rebind whichever side you use more.

## Datapack hooks

Some things aren't config keys at all, because a tag or a data file does the job better. All of these work from an ordinary datapack, and all of them are overridable without touching the mod.

### Where a breed lives

Each breed reads its own **biome tag**. This is how you get horses into modded biomes.

```
data/icys-better-horses/tags/worldgen/biome/spawns/<breed>.json
```

```json
{ "replace": false, "values": ["yourmod:redwood_forest"] }
```

With `"replace": false` your entries are added to the mod's own list rather than replacing it. There is also an umbrella tag, `icys-better-horses:spawns_horses`, which decides where horses spawn **at all**; it just includes the fifteen per-breed tags, so adding a biome to any breed tag adds it to both.

See [Spawning](spawning#modded-biomes) for the worked example.

### What a breed is

```
data/icys-better-horses/better_horses/breed/<breed>.json
```

```json
{
  "class": "draft",
  "chest_rows": 4,
  "bonded_chest_rows": 4,
  "spawn_weight": 5
}
```

| Field | What it does |
|:---|:---|
| `class` | Which [class](breeds/index) the breed belongs to: `race`, `war`, `western`, `draft`, or `pony`. Sets its stat range, damage, spook chance, and class perks |
| `chest_rows` | Storage rows with a chest fitted, 0 to 6 |
| `bonded_chest_rows` | Rows once the horse reaches bond 100. Never lower than `chest_rows` |
| `spawn_weight` | How likely this breed is when a horse spawns in a biome it shares with others. A plains horse rolls between the eight plains breeds by weight |

Every field is optional; anything you leave out keeps the mod's value. These reload with `/reload` and are sent to every player on a server, so clients do not need the datapack.

### Other tags

| Tag | Type | What it controls |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `icys-better-horses:ploughable` | block | What the cart [plough](equipment/horse-cart#fitting-a-plough) turns into farmland |
| `icys-better-horses:cart_cargo_blocked` | entity type | Mobs that may never ride in a cart bed |
| `icys-better-horses:cart_cargo_allowed` | entity type | Mobs that may ride regardless of size, for anything too wide by default |
| `icys-better-horses:horse_breakable` | block | What a bonded Belgian or Shire can smash at a gallop |
| `icys-better-horses:horse_road` | block | What counts as a road for the Western class speed bonus |

## Common setups

**Shared/community server.** Let everyone use every horse:

```json
{ "horse_exclusivity": "no" }
```

{: .tip }
> Before reaching for this, consider leaving exclusivity on and having players run `/horse trust <player>` for the friends they actually ride with. Trusted players get everything except disowning, so ownership itself stays protected. See [Commands](commands).

**Vanilla-flavoured.** Keep the breeds, bonding, and riding fixes but drop the gadgets:

```json
{ "stabilizer": "no", "medkit": "no" }
```

**Breeds without the powers.** Keep fifteen breeds with their own stats, coats, and biome ranges, but no special abilities:

```json
{ "abilities": { "class_abilities": "no", "breed_abilities": "no" } }
```

**PvE server.** Horses fight mobs but never players or their pets:

```json
{ "horse_pvp": "no" }
```

**Faster bonding.** Full bond in 25 minutes instead of 100:

```json
{ "tuning": { "bond_per_interval": 4 } }
```

**Let another mod handle spawning.** Keep everything else, add no horse spawns:

```json
{ "tuning": { "spawn_weight": 0 } }
```

**Solo play.** No reason to change anything. The defaults are the intended experience.
